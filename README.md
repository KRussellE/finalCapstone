  ¤ The program select all records with a grade between 60 and 80.
  ¤ Then the program changes Carl Davis’s grade to 65.
  ¤ Then deletes Dennis Fredrickson’s row.
  ¤ Finally changes the grade of all people with an id below 55.
 The program will create (if it does not already exist) the programming.db file

<!-- Installation -->
## Installation

Copy the files to your local machine to a folder of your choice.

<!-- Instructions -->
## Instructions

The user run the database.py file and the file will itself create the python_programming table. The user can not change/influence the input or output datas because the program wont ask him. The program itself will create the input datas (the table what you see above) and make the changes what under the table. The user only will see the ouput (the final table after change).
